        <p class="font-weight-light">Hi, my name is Marcos Rivera and I'm currently a Software Development student who enjoys solving
            complex problems with creative/innovative solutions. I’ve made a positive impact by integrating one-on-one Java tutoring
            to enhance my communication skills and understanding of data structures. As I coordinate team projects, I ensure a safe,
            inclusive, and respectful working environment to diversify/engage positive collaboration. I'm seeking internships for
            improving, enhancing, and analyzing back-end development while gaining exposure to video game development such as
            interactive/immersive user experience.</p>
