            <p class="font-weight-light">Welcome, I would like to share my great interest within the computer software field as I have
            grown to appreciate the advancements of technology that grants ease-of-access to various individuals. Although
            my interests for learning programming stemmed from the use of video games, my true involvement for learning
            grew from my experience within the Skills USA team and Teals programming team from high school. Also, my
            experience within the learning environment of java programming in college. More importantly, my knowledge of
            programming extended to various views where I find myself fascinated with artificial intelligence, constructions
            of cloud computing, as well as the importance of data security within databases. Truly, after some experience in
            programming and continuing onward with my education, I feel passionate of ensuring accessibility within my
            community through the use of applications I may create to better their lives as well as understanding the
            utilization of programming. My future goals for applying my skills will be in video game development as I will hone my
            problem-solving strategies, multi-platform usability, and continuous engagement with challenges!</p>
